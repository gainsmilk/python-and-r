# Programming with Python and R

## 🚀 Overview
This repo holds my uni **Python and R course** and all the weird stuff I’ll end up writing here.

> Everything here is **student work** and kept simple, but **I’ll still overengineer the sh*t out of it when I want to**.

## Quickstart
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gainsmilk/python-and-r.git
cd python-and-r

# Python setup
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Jump into any class folder you want
cd dd-mm-yy-class/
```

## Structure
```text
python-and-r/
├─ .gitignore
├─ LICENSE
├─ README.md
└─ dd-mm-yy-class/
   └─ src/  # Code
```

**Note:** All class folders follow the format `dd-mm-yy-class/`, and materials + extras live in the class folder root.

## License
[MIT](LICENSE) - if you somehow end up with the same materials at your uni, **feel free to permanently borrow this code**.
