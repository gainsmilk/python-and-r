# Python 12 Data Types and Operators

Category: `python`

## Assignment 2: Data Types and Operators

## Tasks

1. Perform basic arithmetic operations with `x = 10` and `y = 3`.
2. Convert an integer into a string and concatenate it with another string.
3. Use `bool()` to check the truthiness of:
- `0`
- `""`
- `"Python"`
- `-5`

## Tips

- The `//` operator performs floor division.
- Convert numbers to strings using `str()`.
- In Python, empty values (`0`, `""`, `None`) are `False`, while non-empty values are `True`.
